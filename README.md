# FlightsSystem

FlightsSystem is a project that simulates a flight management system and a flight search engine. 

It includes a CMS for the administrator, who can manipulate the information about all flights. He has
the permissions to add new flights, to edit flights details, visualize passengers information and
cancel passengers bookings.

Users of the search flights engine can look up for flights by destination and date criterias. They get
information for the searched flights and can book the desired flight. Bookings are confirmed by users receiving an
sms with the flights details. Users have access to a personalized calendar that keeps track of all their
past and future flights.
